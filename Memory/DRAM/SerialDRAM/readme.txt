Serial Interface DRAM - A new type of DRAM that utilizes 
on-chip scheduling of 
datapaths(decoupling the system CPU from the memory management,
turning DRAM control to memory itself) instead of CPU DRAM controllers
 micromanaging everything.
The scheduling software will require a firmware from manufacturer,
which is likely to be a closed source blob.

(This will be handled by new memory on-chip firmware)
