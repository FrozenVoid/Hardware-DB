An internal handle design
replaces external(above surface)
handles by modifying space in
the door itself to accomodate
a reachable hole with two openings
for a hand that look like (O|O)
where 0's are large vertical holes and 
| is a handle that is identical 
horizontally with normal surface.

  ASCII depiction of design:
  ()=surface curves down

Advantages:
Removal of door handle as component
Easier transport and assembly.

vs Recessed handle: much simpler
mechanically and stronger(as entire
door is used as handle surface)
vs Side Handle: Less strain on 
door hinges/mechanism(vertical strain)

Disadvantages:
Low door thickness at handle location
must be compensated by other side
of door having a prominence(equal
to handle volume),
which lowers some space inside.
