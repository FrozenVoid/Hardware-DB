The common design of lower
shelves as a retractable box
is impractical waste of
space: the reach is hard vs any
 higher shelf(requires user to bend
 down) and box often breaks(due
 being fragile plastic).

Instead why not use the lowest
shelf space for fridge internals?
The loss of volume is compensated
by increase in available space
 higher(i.e. making higher shelves
 wider/deeper) in the fridge,
with more optimal allocation for
convinience(easier to reach and 
store).

What should be the lowest
 shelf location?
The average height person should
be able to reach one without 
bending knees. 

Depth:
Ergonomically,
depth of shelf must also be limited
to hand length - smaller fridges
should use wider shelves instead
of deeper shelves(i.e. book-case
 like design instead of square
 tower).
