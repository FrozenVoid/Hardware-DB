Adjusting NoFrost manually with
an on/off switch could
 save lots of electricity wasted
 on defrosting cycles, also
improving freezing duration
 during power loss
 events/grid failures:effectively
 turning NoFrost fridge into 
 normal frost refridgerator.

Some products in sealed containers
will be better stored without
noFrost temperature fluctuation,
as their internal ice crystals
will accumulate regardless of 
efforts of ventilation system.
