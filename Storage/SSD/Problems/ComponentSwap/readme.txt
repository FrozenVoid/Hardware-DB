Problem:
Some companies alter/swap the SSD components that doesn't
get reflected in the model number/name and without altering the spec sheet.
This usually occurs with low-end consumer SSDs, where
a company replaces more expensive components with cheaper ones:
though opposite 'upgrades' can occur, where older components are replaced
by newer(but not cheaper) components.
