LEDectomy is the removal of LEDs(gamer-related crap meant to adds extra light for marketing appeal in children).
Blue light is especially harmful to eyes.

Steps:
1.Disconnect mice.
2.Find the screws. Its often hidden behind labels or plastic fittings.
3.unscrew all screws. If no screws exists, try prying slowly the sides of mouse from front to determine where plastic sheaths connect and push them apart: pressing the mice from sides or pushing in some lever-object might help.
4.Locate the LED(s), the main mouse LED(located at mouse center mirror) can't be removed(its for providing movement info) but can be obscured by strategically placing black tape over the parts of plastic sheath from inside.(Laser mice have a small emitter near mirror which doesn't spread much light.)
5.Use scissors to cut the LEDs connecting wires or move the LED from side to side slowly so the wires snap from overload.
6.repack the plastic sheath over the mouse guts.
7.Screw back everything or push the plastic sheaths into their slots.
8.Test the mice. If you didn't damage anything else, the mouse will stop
illuminating the room.
