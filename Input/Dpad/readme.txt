D-pad(direction pad) is a direction input device:

Canonical implementation used for joysticks 
is the early 90's design of 8-direction D-pad that was popularized by Sega Genesis/MegaDrive.

D-pad allow a single-direction input(e.g. right+up) to register
as smooth 2-d movement (+x up,+x right), allowing fast reaction in video games that is discrete and more accurate than analog 'joystick' movement
and more flexible than 4-direction arrowkey/button setup(which require
 two keys/buttons to be pressed). 
Modern (mobile) implementation use a touch-screen interface which registers
angle from center as direction, providing 'infinite' direction d-pad
that is usually less accurate than D-pad(similar to analog 'joysticks')
but provides more range(e.g. angle vs 8-directions).
