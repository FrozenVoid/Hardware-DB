D-pad(direction pad) is a direction input device:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad
Canonical implementation used for joysticks 
is the early 90's design of 8-direction D-pad that was popularized by Sega Genesis/MegaDrive.(In theory 16-direction D-pad would provide more accuracy,
but most video game movement is too discrete to utilize this and very few 16-direction
controllers exist, plus amount of directions loses 'discreteness' of action making it more analog and imprecise/ambiguous when 2+ switches(e.g. up+upleft1(left+1) +upleft2(left+2) are pressed )).

D-pad allow a single-direction input(e.g. right+up) to register
as smooth 2-d movement (+x up,+x right), allowing fast reaction in video games that is discrete and more accurate than analog 'joystick' movement
and more flexible than 4-direction arrowkey/button setup(which require
 two keys/buttons to be pressed). 
Modern (mobile) implementation use a touch-screen interface which registers
angle from center as direction, providing 'infinite' direction d-pad
that is usually less accurate than D-pad(similar to analog 'joysticks')
but provides more range(e.g. angle vs 8-directions).
