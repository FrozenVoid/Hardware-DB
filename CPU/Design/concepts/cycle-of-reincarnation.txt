a concept that explain how CPUs absorb the 
functions of other processing devices;
1.First the CPU is slow to do X.
so another specialized processing unit is created(e.g. GPU)
to perform X much faster.
2.The specialized processing unit evolves to be generic(FPU)
and is integrated into the processor(FPU,iGPU).
3.The unit functionality is absorbed into the processor
instruction set( extensions, vectors, memories).
4.as CPU becomes more complex and inflexible, the expensive functionality
is spun-off into dedicated hardware and cycle begins again.
