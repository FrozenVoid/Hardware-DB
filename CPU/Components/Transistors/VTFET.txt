IBM and Samsung claim they’ve
made a breakthrough in 
semiconductor design. On day one 

of the IEDM conference in 
San Francisco, the two companies
unveiled a new design for 
stacking transistors vertically
on a chip. With current 
processors and SoCs, transistors
lie flat on the surface of the 
silicon, and then electric
current flows from side-to-side.
By contrast, Vertical Transport
Field Effect Transistors (VTFET)
sit perpendicular to one another 
and current flows vertically.

According to IBM and Samsung,
this design has two advantages.
First, it will allow them to

bypass many performance 
limitations to extend Moore’s Law
beyond IBM's current nanosheet 
technology. More importantly, 
the design leads to less wasted
energy thanks to greater current
flow. They estimate VTFET will 
lead to processors that are 
either twice as fast or use 
85 percent less power than chips
designed with FinFET transistors.
IBM and Samsung claim the process
may one day allow for phones 
that go a full week on a 
single charge. They say it could
also make certain energy-intensive
tasks, including cryptomining, 
more power-efficient and 
therefore less impactful on the
environment.
