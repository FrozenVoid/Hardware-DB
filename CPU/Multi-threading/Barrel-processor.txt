a Barrel processor allows programs to use hardware threads by interleaved execution
on same CPU, with each thread assigned its own registers and stack.
After each CPU cycle the CPU switches to next thread, with each thread having
 speed of 1/n of CPU(where n is amount of hardware threads running).

Main disadvantages of Barrel processors are cache invalidation and
 speed of single-threded application which is substantially lowered vs one-thread/one-core design.
