A Dream Machine is a hypothethical hardware that would allow to control and/or record dreams. In-Dream editing could be an alternative form of Virtual Reality: the machine would put one into an artificial REM sleep and provide Lucid Dreaming cues(interfaces) for editing/recording the content and maintaining lucidity.

Some ideas:
1. Dreaming is essentially an uncontrolled virtual reality.
Dream machines would  bring this under human control.
Editing lucid dreams could be a mundane, reproducible creative process.

2.Astral Projection can be made a common activity by engineering "Exit Dreams" and Lucid Dream will be default for anyone using a dream machine.
Some machines can induce lucid dreaming by sending waking hints.

3.Dreams have untapped creative potential lost because they're not recorded: new genres of art based on dream editing/recording/reproduction could become a form of VR-world sharing: people could share and construct specific scenarios/objects to use in dreaming.
current research suggests dreams are recordable in principle
even from fMRI scans though high-fidelity recording will likely
require interface to visual cortex;
