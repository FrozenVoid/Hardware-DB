From 2003 Franco Cotana led the development
of Pipenet which had a small bore evacuated 
tube for moving freight at up to 2,000 km/h
(1,200 mph) using linear synchronous motors
and magnetic levitation. A prototype system 
- 100 m (110 yd) long and 1.25 m (1.37 yd)
in diameter - was constructed in Italy in 2005. 
However development stopped after funding ceased.
